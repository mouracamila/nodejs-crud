# NodeJS aplication with CRUD

## Introduction

This is a basic structure for a project management application.

### Technologies used and their definitions:

- **NodeJS**: As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.
- **Express**: Framework for building web applications on top of NodeJS.
- **CRUD**: Acronum for **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate and **D**elete. It is set of operation for servers to execute (POST, GET PUT and DELETE).
- **UUID**: Generator of unique identifiers for objects.
- **Query parameters**: Are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url. They are extensions of the URL that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. Making filtering and paging possible.
- **JSON**: The json() method of the Body mixin takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise that resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
- **Nodemon**: Utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.
